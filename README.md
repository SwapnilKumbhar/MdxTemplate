# Nextjs + MDX + TailwindCSS

This template builds upon the [with-tailwindcss](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/with-tailwindcss) example from Nextjs's templates by adding MDX. The template itself is a basic blog that uses [next-mdx-remote](https://www.github.com/hashicorp/next-mdx-remote) to render MDX blog pages.

The project here is described in my blog [here](https://www.swapnilk.xyz/posts/how-mdx-powers-my-blog). 

## Running the project

Clone the repository, install all dependencies using `npm ci`. Then run this to run the server -
